# CLI-APPLICATION-INSTALLER

The CLI app installer is a custom command-line tool designed to simplify the installation of applications and utilities. It leverages the power of Chocolatey, a popular package manager for Windows, to manage the installation process. 

With this app installer, you can specify the software package or repository name as input and the tool then uses Chocolatey to fetch the necessary package information, download the required files, and handle the installation automatically. It can be easily integrated into scripts or used interactively to install multiple applications quickly. 

Overall, the CLI app installer enhances productivity and efficiency by automating the installation of software, making it a valuable tool for system administrators, developers, or any user who frequently installs applications and utilities.
