## Solving a probelm...?
I always have to install a specific set of softwares everytime on a new machine. <br>
Tried using Ninite but that also has limited options. <br>
Also I wanted to advance in Shell Scripting. <br>

## Windows.bat

Run this as Administrator <br>
Checks for Chocolatey and Installs it (if required) <br>

Has two options <br>
  - Using a Txt File full of Pkg names <br>
  - Typing the Pkg names in the instance <br>

Also Updates Oudated Pkgs <br>

## Linux.sh
## Mac.sh
Are these worth it... ðŸ¤”
### And its Safe don't worry ðŸ‘€
