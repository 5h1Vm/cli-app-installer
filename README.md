## Solving a problem...maybe?
Was tired of manually installing applications and dependencies everytime I use any new machine ðŸ¥² <br>
yes I have tried Ninite and others.. but wasn't satisfied.. <br>
And... I wanted to advance in Win shell scripting. <br>

## [Windows.bat](https://github.com/5h1Vm/cli-app-installer/blob/main/Windows.bat)

Run this as Administrator <br>
Has Winget for installing from Microsoft Store and is also Chocolatey ðŸ˜ƒ <br>

Has two options for both Pkg Managers...<br>
  - Using a Txt File full of Pkg names <br>
  - Typing the Pkg names in the instance <br>

Also Updates Oudated Pkgs <br>

## Linux.sh
